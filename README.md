# data-engineering-project
End-to-End Data Engineering Project with Microsoft Fabric

The goal of this project is to design and implement a fully functional end-to-end data engineering 
and analytics solution using Microsoft Fabric. The solution will ingest raw data from source 
systems, process and refine it through multiple transformation layers (such as bronze, silver, and 
gold in a medallion architecture), implement scalable data pipelines using Fabric components 
(e.g., pipelines, notebooks), and finally deliver actionable insights through reporting and 
analytics.
